[**Summer Youth Employment**](https://max-gross.github.io/website_documents/detroit_summer_employment.pdf): 
Summer youth employment programs are a popular way for municipalities to provide
adolescents with skills and experiences thought to improve labor market outcomes.
While research evidence on such programs has grown in recent years, it is still limited.
In particular, it is not clear how, if at all, participation influences key educational
outcomes. We study the program in Detroit, Michigan using a selection on observables
identification strategy. In addition to controlling for a rich set of covariates, including
baseline educational measures, we match participants to their classmates of the same
race and gender who applied for the program, but did not participate. We find
that participation is associated with a modest increase in educational attainment.
Specifically, it increased the likelihood of enrolling in public school after the program
by 1.5% and of graduating high school by 4%, relative to comparison means of 94.5%
and 85%. Youth with the weakest academic skills benefited the most, as participation
increased school enrollment by 2.2% and high school graduation by 5.5% for this group.
Falsification tests of whether participation predicts pre-program characteristics as well
as bounding exercises to account for omitted variables offer support that our results represent true effects of the program and not selection.
