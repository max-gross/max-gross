[**Summer Youth Employment**](https://max-gross.github.io/website_documents/detroit_summer_employment.pdf): 
Summer youth employment programs are a popular way for municipalities to provide
adolescents with skills and experiences thought to improve labor market outcomes.
While research evidence on such programs has grown in recent years, it is still limited.
In particular, it is not clear how, if at all, participation influences key educational
outcomes. We study the program in Detroit, Michigan using a selection on observables
identification strategy. In addition to controlling for a rich set of covariates, including
baseline educational measures, we match participants to their classmates of the same
race and gender who applied for the program, but did not participate. We find
that participation is associated with a modest increase in educational attainment.
Specifically, it increased the likelihood of enrolling in public school after the program
by 1.5% and of graduating high school by 4%, relative to comparison means of 94.5%
and 85%. Youth with the weakest academic skills benefited the most, as participation
increased school enrollment by 2.2% and high school graduation by 5.5% for this group.
Falsification tests of whether participation predicts pre-program characteristics as well
as bounding exercises to account for omitted variables offer support that our results represent true effects of the program and not selection.

[**Early Exposure to Child Maltreatment and Academic Outcomes**](https://max-gross.github.io/website_documents/child_maltreatment_academic_outcomes.pdf): 
Early childhood trauma increases the risk of academic difficulties. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of
early contact with child protection services (CPS) and to determine whether early exposure to maltreatment investigations was
associated with important academic outcomes. The authors focused specifically on standardized test scores (math and reading),
grade retention, and special education status in third grade. The sample was diverse and included all children born between 2000
and 2006 and enrolled in Michiganâ€™s public schools (N= 732,838). By the time these students reached third grade, approximately
18% were associated with a formal CPS investigation. In some school districts, more than 50% of third graders were associated
with an investigation. African American and poor students were more likely to be investigated for maltreatment. Children
associated with maltreatment investigations scored significantly lower on standardized math and reading tests, were more
likely to be identified as needing special education, and were more likely to be held back at least one grade. These findings
indicate that involvement with CPS is not an infrequent event in the lives of young children and that within some school districts,
maltreatment investigations are the norm. Child welfare and educational systems must collaborate so that the early academic
struggles experienced by victims of maltreatment do not mature into more complicated difficulties later in life.
