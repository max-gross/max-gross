A native of Cherry Hill, NJ, I graduated from the University of Maryland in 2014 with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics and a Bachelor of Arts in economics. I continued my studies in economics at the University of Michigan the following fall, receiving a masters degree in 2015. I will be completing my Ph.D. in April 2020.

I am an applied microeconomist who focuses on the economics of education and labor economics. My current work uses large administrative data sources and quasi-experimental research designs to study the effects of various public policies and programs. My research is motivated by a commitment to improve the lives of historically underserved students and to close opportunity gaps. I am happy to be affiliated with the [Education Policy Initiative](http://www.edpolicy.umich.edu/) and [Youth Policy Lab](http://youthpolicylab.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan.

I'm a data-driven researcher, a competitive volleyball player, an adventurous home cook, a strong believer that we live in the golden age of television, and a [truster of the process](https://www.theringer.com/2017/6/21/16038856/sam-hinkie-philadelphia-76ers-process-draft-markelle-fultz-bb1b060ee4a5).
