Originally from the Philadelphia area, I graduated from the University of Maryland in 2014 with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics and a Bachelor of Arts in economics. I continued studying economics at the University of Michigan the following fall and will complete my Ph.D. in Winter 2020. Beginning in July 2020, I am excited to join [Mathematica](https://www.mathematica.org/) as a Human Services Researcher.

I am an applied microeconomist whose research is motivated by improving the lives of historically underserved children. With a focus on labor economics and the economics of education, I use large administrative data and quasi-experimental methods to engage with public policy. I am happy to be affiliated with the [Education Policy Initiative](http://www.edpolicy.umich.edu/) and [Youth Policy Lab](http://youthpolicylab.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan.

Outside of my professional life, I am a dedicated volunteer for a [supportive housing nonprofit](https://www.avalonhousing.org/), a competitive volleyball player, an adventurous home cook, a strong believer that we live in the golden age of television, and a [truster of the process](https://www.theringer.com/2017/6/21/16038856/sam-hinkie-philadelphia-76ers-process-draft-markelle-fultz-bb1b060ee4a5).
