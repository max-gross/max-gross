I am a PhD candidate in economics at the University of Michigan and an Institute of Education Sciences predoctoral fellow. I study the economics of education, labor economics, and public policy.  

My research uses large administrative data sources from the education, child welfare, and criminal justice systems to evaluate government policies and programs. I seek to understand how public institutions influence the lives of historically underserved students.  

I'm a data-driven researcher, a volleyball player, a home cook, and a [truster of the process](https://www.theringer.com/2017/6/21/16038856/sam-hinkie-philadelphia-76ers-process-draft-markelle-fultz-bb1b060ee4a5).
