I am a PhD candidate in economics at the University of Michigan and an Institute of Education Sciences predoctoral fellow. I study the economics of education, labor economics, and public policy.  

My research uses large administrative data sources from the education, child welfare, and criminal justice systems to evaluate government policies and programs. I seek to understand how our institutions can better care for historically underserved students.
