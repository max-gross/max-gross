A native of Cherry Hill, NJ, I graduated from the University of Maryland in 2014 with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics and a Bachelor of Arts in economics. Following my undergraduate studies, I began graduate studies in economics at the University of Michigan, receiving a masters degree in economics in 2015 and expect to complete a doctorate degree in April 2020.

Having grown up in a family of social workers, my research is motivated by a commitment to improve the lives of historically underserved students and close opportunity gaps. I am an applied microeconomist who focuses on the economics of education and labor economics. My current work uses large administrative data sources and quasi-experimental research designs to study the effects of various public policies and programs. I am happy to be affiliated with the Education Policy Initiative and Youth Policy Lab at the University of Michigan.

I'm a data-driven researcher, a competitive volleyball player, an adventurous home cook, a strong believer that we live in the golden age of television, and a [truster of the process](https://www.theringer.com/2017/6/21/16038856/sam-hinkie-philadelphia-76ers-process-draft-markelle-fultz-bb1b060ee4a5).
