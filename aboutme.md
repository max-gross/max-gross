XYZ is why I am interested in this work.  

I graduated from the University of Maryland with Bachelors degrees in economics and mathematics. 

I'm a data-driven researcher, a volleyball player, a home cook, and a [truster of the process](https://www.theringer.com/2017/6/21/16038856/sam-hinkie-philadelphia-76ers-process-draft-markelle-fultz-bb1b060ee4a5).
